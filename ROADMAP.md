Roadmap
*******
- complete redesign of §cP interface, new CSS code to became fully resposive (very soon!)
- sync with USB alsa audio does not work, fix it!
- .svg to .xml parser to import .svg from mapping softwares to mapper (https://github.com/magdesign/mapping-converter)
- remove seamless button in autostart since script automatically detects
- jump to next file button
- get into pi3d: http://pi3d.github.io/html/ReadMe.html#setup-on-the-raspberry-pi maybe do a mapper + slidshow with this
- get into shaders: http://journeytounknownsoundscapes.blogspot.ch/2013/02/raspi-as-poor-mans-video-jockey.html?m=1
- more shader stuff: https://github.com/dff180/pishadertoy

- mapper: compile shortcut for bigmove, make moves even bigger, also small moves
- mapper: remote buttons for scaling up and scaling down

- make mapper working without mouse

- screen controls for color, brightness, contrast (openframeworks solution?)
- adding a screen recorder to record a TCPSyphon stream (tried it, not enough power on the RPi yet)
- Make sync script compatible with video mapper
